  <p>Successfully authenticated with the Strava API</p>

  <p>Your refresh token is:</p>
  <code>{{ token }}</code>
  <p>It is valid for the following scope(s):</p>
  <code>{{ scopes }}</code>

  <p>
    Give it to applications when prompted. Be aware that doing so will give that
    application access to the above scopes of your Strava account.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that this is a refresh token, not an access token. In order to access
    the Strava API, the refresh token needs to be used to generate a
    short-lived access token. See
    <a href="https://developers.strava.com/docs/authentication/#refresh-expired-access-tokens">the Strava API authentication docs</a>
    for more information.
